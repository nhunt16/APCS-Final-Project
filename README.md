# APCS-Final-Project

Okay so I made a minecraft mod and uploaded the src or main source file. 
To use my code simply download forge set it up in eclipe (I used eclipse NEON), set your Minecraft client to 1.7.10,
and replace the default src file. Now all you have to do is run the program in the IDE and 
the mod should build and run. I'm sure there is a way to use the src file in a normal Minecraft client but I don't know for sure.
Run into any troubles? Watch this tutorial on setting up a mac forge mod: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhc3I9jx474".
